<h4 class="TitleContinuation">Addendum to the Mobile Information Device Profile version 2.0</h4>
    <hr>
<h5 class="TitleContinuation"><i>Copyright 2002, Sun Microsystems,
      Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.</i></h5>
    <hr>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">Preface</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">This document, <i>The Recommended Security Policy for GSM/UMTS
	Compliant Devices</i> is an addendum to
the <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/118.jsp">Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) version 2.0</a> for the
Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME<sup>TM</sup>).
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The terminology used herein is defined by
that specification except where noted. 
</p>

<h2 class="ChapterTitle">Who Should Use This Document</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">The audience for this document is the Java
Community Process (JCP) Expert Group that defined the MIDP,
implementers of the MIDP, application developers using the MIDP,
service providers deploying MIDP applications, and wireless operators
deploying the infrastructure to support MIDP devices. This document
specifically targets network operators, manufacturers, and
service and application providers operating in GSM and UMTS networks.
</p>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">Scope of This Document</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">This addendum is informative.
However, all implementations of MIDP 2.0 on GSM/UMTS-compliant
devices are expected to comply with this addendum.</p>

<p class="Paragraph"> MIDP 2.0 defines the framework for
authenticating the source of a MIDlet suite and authorizing the
MIDlet suite to perform protected functions by granting permissions
it may have requested based on the security policy on the device. It
also identifies functions that are deemed security-vulnerable and
defines permissions for those protected functions. Additionally, MIDP
2.0 specifies  the common rules for APIs that can be used
together with the MIDP but are specified outside the MIDP. MIDP 2.0
specification does not mandate a single trust model but rather allows
the model to accord with the device trust policy. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The purpose of this addendum is to extend the base MIDlet suite
security framework defined in MIDP 2.0 and to define the following
areas: 
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">The required trust model for GSM/UMTS-compliant devices 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">The domain number and structure, as reflected in the
	       policy file
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">The mechanism of reading root keys
	  from sources external to the device 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Capabilities allowed the
	  applications within permissions defined by MIDP 2.0 and other JSRs 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Application behaviour in the roaming network
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Application behaviour when SIM/USIM is changed 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">The use of user permission types 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Guidelines on user prompts and notifications 
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">How This Specification Is Organized</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">This specification is organized as follows:</p>

<p class="Paragraph"> Sections 2 to 4 establish the relationship
between the policy file, different security domains, and requirements
concerning certificate storage on smart cards. Section 5 specifies
the function groups and identifies the permissions and the APIs that
need to be protected using the MIDP 2.0 security framework. Sections
6 and 7 specify rules that must be followed when permissions are
granted, and also requirements of user notifications. Finally Section
8 specifies the MIDlet behaviour during roaming and after changing
the smart card.</p>

<p class="Paragraph"><h2 class="ChapterTitle">1  General</h2></p>
<p class="Paragraph">GSM/UMTS-compliant devices MUST follow the
security framework specified in the MIDP 2.0. Additionally, devices
that support trusted applications MUST follow the PKI-based
authentication scheme as defined in MIDP 2.0 specification. 
</p>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">2  Domains in the Policy File</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">A domain is a way to differentiate between
downloaded MIDlets based on their origin, and to grant or make
available to a MIDlet suite a set of permissions. A domain binds a
root certificate to a set of permissions. The permissions are
specified in the domain policy. A policy file or policy has as many
entries as there are domains available on the device.  A domain
can exist only for root certificates that contain the
<code>id-kp-codeSigning</code> extended key usage extension.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Applications that authenticate to a trusted root key are treated
as trusted, and assigned to the corresponding  protection
domain. An application MUST be assigned to only one protection
domain. A MIDlet suite cannot belong to more than one protection
domain. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The representation of domains in the device is
implementation-specific.</p>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">3  Security Domains and the Permissions
Framework</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">This document specifies two different
requirements as to how the MIDP permissions framework should be used,
depending on the security domain an application executes.</p>
<p class="Paragraph"> </p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Manufacturer and Operator Domains</b> &#8211;
Applications are responsible for prompting the user, using the MIDP
2.0 permissions framework when accessing functions for which security
policies are specified in Tables 2 through 6 in this document.</p>
<p class="Paragraph"> </p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Third-Party and Untrusted Domains</b> &#8211;
The device implementation is responsible for prompting the user
according to the security policies specified in Tables 1 through 5 in
this document.</p>
<h4>3.1 Manufacturer Domain</h4>
<p class="Paragraph">The trusted root certificate of the device manufacturer is related
to manufacturer applications and MUST have a domain
identified in the policy file. If a given device has no Manufacturer
domain but is capable of authenticating manufacturer-signed
applications (that is, it has a manufacturer root certificate
installed) they will be authorized only as untrusted and will belong
to the Untrusted domain.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The Manufacturer domain cannot be deleted or modified by the user
or any other party, except by a device-provisioned capability. 
If the manufacturer root certificate is updated, it MUST be mapped
onto the same Manufacturer-domain policy file. If the manufacturer
root certificate is no longer present on the device, the Manufacturer
domain may be removed by a device-provisioned capability. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Permissions in the Manufacturer domain are all marked as
<i>Allowed</i> (see MIDP 2.0 for the definition). Permissions granted by
the Manufacturer domain as <i>Allowed</i> imply that downloaded and
authenticated manufacturer applications perform consistently with
applications pre-installed by the manufacturer in terms of security
and prompts to the user whenever events that require user
acknowledgment occur. Manufacturer applications SHOULD seek
permission from the user when accessing security-vulnerable APIs and
functions. Permissions defined by MIDP 2.0 and other APIs give the
guidelines of which functions are seen as security-vulnerable and
need protection. It is expected that manufacturer applications will
give prompts and notifications to the user consistently regarding
these security-protected functions. The implementation MUST present
the user with the <i>Subject</i> field of the root certificate
containing the manufacturer root public key whenever a new
application is installed in the Manufacturer domain. This user
notification MUST take place at application installation.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The Manufacturer domain imposes no restriction on the capabilities
specified in the MIDP 2.0 and other JSRs. 
</p>
<h4>3.2 Operator Domain</h4>
<p class="Paragraph">The trusted operator root certificate MUST be
mapped onto the policy file describing the Operator domain on the
device. A device MUST support the policy file describing the Operator
domain.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">If a given device has no Operator domain but is
capable of authenticating operator-signed applications (that is, it
is able to obtain an operator root certificate from a smart card)
they will be authorized only as untrusted and will belong to the Untrusted domain. 
</p>

<p class="Paragraph">Trusted root certificates are read from the Certificate Directory
File (CDF) for trusted certificates [WIM]. Root certificates found in
the trustedCertificates file on the WIM are mapped onto the Operator
domain or onto the Trusted Third-Party domain,
depending on the trustedUsage field in the
CommonCertificateAttributes associated with the certificate
[PKCS15]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Paragraph">If the trustedUsage field is present and contains the OID for key usage
&#8220;Operator Domain&#8221; (to be defined), then the certificate
is to be mapped onto the Operator domain.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">If the trustedUsage
field is not present, or does not contain the OID for key usage
&#8220;Operator Domain,&#8221; then the certificate is to be mapped
onto the Trusted Third-Party domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="Paragraph">Operator-trusted root certificates may be placed
in the trustedCertificates Certificate Directory File (CDF) of a WIM,
SIM, or USIM. If operator root certificates are stored directly on a
SIM or USIM, that is, not under the WIM application, then they shall
be stored in the EF trustedCertificates CDF located under
DF(PKCS#15), as defined by [SCPROV]. Operator root certificates can
be obtained only from the trusted CDF or equivalent directory (the
card holder can not update this directory) and not from any
other directory of the smart card. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">As operator root certificates are external to the device itself,
and it is not known in advance which root certificates are available
for authenticating downloaded operator applications at the time the
smart card can be changed, mapping of the operator root certificates
onto the Operator domain is implementation-specific. Any operator
root certificate MUST, however, be mapped onto the same set of
<i>Allowed </i>permissions in the Operator domain. The Operator
domain cannot be deleted or modified by the user or any other party,
except by a device-provisioned capability. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">A signed and authenticated application MUST be authorized to the Operator
domain if the application was authenticated to the operator root public key.
The operator root public key MUST be obtained from the trusted CDF of a currently
inserted and enabled smart card and not from any other location on the smart
card or the device. The implementation MUST present the user with the <e>Subject</i>
field of the root certificate containing the operator root public
key whenever a new application is installed in the Operator domain.
This user notification MUST take place at application
installation.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">Permissions in the Operator domain are all marked as<i> Allowed
</i>(see MIDP 2.0 for the definition). Permissions granted by the Operator domain as <i>Allowed</i> imply that downloaded and
authenticated operator applications perform consistently with other
applications installed by the operator in terms of security and
prompts to the user whenever events that require user acknowledgment
occur. Operator applications SHOULD seek permission from the user
when accessing security-vulnerable APIs and functions. Permissions
defined by MIDP 2.0 and other APIs provide guidelines as to which
functions are seen as security-vulnerable and need protection. It is
expected that operator-trusted applications will give prompts and
notifications to the user when accessing these security-protected
functions.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">The Operator domain imposes no restriction on the capabilities
specified in the MIDP 2.0 and other APIs unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">MIDlets installed in the Operator domain MUST store, along with
the application itself, a hash of the root certificate public key
under which the signing certificate used to sign the application was
issued. The hash algorithm to be used is the following: starting with
the root certificate, compute the 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the value of
the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and
number of unused bits) of that certificate.  This method is
commonly used to compute key identifiers, especially to accelerate
trust-chain building [RFC3280, &sect;4.2.1.2]. The implementation
MUST NOT assume for optimization purposes that X.509 key identifiers
or PKCS#15 labels are the correct value; however, and MUST compute
the hash themselves. This hash MUST be used by the device to decide
when a given program should be deactivated, as specified in Section
8. 
</p>
<h4>3.3 Trusted Third-Party Domain</h4>
<p class="Paragraph">There is no explicit limitation on the number of
domains available in a given device.  Applications that
authenticate to a trusted third-party root certificate MUST belong to
a Third-Party domain. If a given device has no Third-Party domain in
the policy file, then a third-party application MUST be authorized
and installed only as untrusted and MUST belong to the Untrusted
domain. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Third-party root certificates downloaded after device
manufacture MUST NOT be used for authentication of MIDlets.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The implementation MUST present the user with the <i>Subject</i>field
of the signing certificate of a MIDlet whenever a new MIDlet is
installed in the Third-Party domain. This user notification MUST take
place at MIDlet installation. When the user is
prompted to grant permissions to an application, the prompt MUST
identify the trusted source with the <i>Subject</i> field of the signing
certificate.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The user must be able to delete or disable trusted third-party
certificates. If a third-party root certificate is to be deleted, the
implementation SHOULD warn the user of the consequence of the
deletion adequately. The user MUST be able to enable a disabled
third-party root certificate. A disabled third-party root certificate
MUST NOT be used to verify downloaded MIDlets. Furthermore,  if
a third-party root certificate is deleted or disabled (for example,
revoked, deleted, or disabled by the user) the Third-Party domain
must no longer be associated with this root certificate. If the user
chooses to delete the root certificate, implementation may provide an
option to delete the applications authenticated to it. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Trusted third-party applications are not granted any permissions
<i>Allowed</i> by the Third-Party domain. All permissions granted by
the Third-Party domain are <i>User</i> permissions, that is, user
interaction is required for permission to be granted. Table 1
specifies the function groups and the available user permission
types for applications in the Third-Party domain. Tables 2 through 6
specify the mapping of permissions and APIs onto different function
groups.
</p>
<h4>3.4 Untrusted Domain</h4>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>MIDlets that are
unsigned will belong to the Untrusted domain.</b></p>
<p class="Paragraph">The implementation MUST inform the
user whenever a new MIDlet is installed in the Untrusted domain. The
notification MUST indicate that the application does not come from a
trusted source.  The user must be able to make an informed
decision based on the available information before granting
permissions to an application. 
</p>

<p class="Paragraph">When the user is prompted to grant
permissions to an application the prompt MUST indicate that the
application does not come from a trusted source.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Untrusted applications MUST NOT gain read access directly to PIM
data through the API defined in JSR 75 (see Table 1 in Section 5).
Interactions between an untrusted application and the PIM data can be
enabled, however, by implementations of the javax.microedition.lcdui
package: when the application programmer sets the constraint
TextField.PHONENUMBER, an implementation of the TextField class MAY
propose that the user look up a number in his or her phone book and
copy it to the TextField item.  For example, when the TextField
item has input focus, the user can access a menu to enter the phone
book; when the user selects an entry in the phone book, the contents
of the selected entry are "copied and pasted" into the
TextField item.  
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Table 1 specifies the function groups and the available user
permissions for applications in the Untrusted domain. Tables 2
through 6 specify the mapping of permissions and APIs onto different
function groups.</p>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">4  Remotely Located Policy File</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">The MIDP 2.0 specification defines the generic
format for the policy file that can be read from removable media.
GSM/UMTS-compliant devices are not expected to use it in the first
phase, but rather to use a single policy file resident on the
device.  The possibility of remotely located policy files is
left for further consideration. 
</p>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">5  Permissions for Downloaded MIDlet Suites</h2>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Mapping MIDP 2.0 Permissions onto Function Groups in
Protected Domains</b></p>
<p class="Paragraph">A device with a small display may not be able to
present all permissions to the user in a single configuration
settings menu in a user-friendly manner. Therefore the device is not
required to present all individual permissions for user confirmation.
Rather, a certain higher-level action triggered by the protected
function should be brought to the user for acceptance.  The
high-level functions presented to the user essentially capture and
reflect the actions and consequences of the underlying individual
permissions. The function groups are as follows: 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Network/cost-related groups: 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Phone Call</b> &#8211; the group represents permissions to
any function that results in a voice call. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Net Access</b> &#8211; the group represents permissions to any
function that results in an active network data connection (for
example GSM, GPRS, UMTS, etc&#8230;); such functions must be mapped to this
group.<br>
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Messaging</b> &#8211; the group represents permissions to
any function that allows sending or receiving messages (for example,
SMS, MMS, etc.) 
</p>

<p class="Paragraph"><b>Application Auto Invocation</b> &#8211; the group represents
permissions to any function that allows a MIDlet to be invoked
automatically (for example, push, timed MIDlets, etc.) 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Local Connectivity</b> &#8211; the group represents
permissions to any function that activates a local port for further
connection (for example, COMM port, IrDa, Bluetooth, etc.) 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">User-privacy-related groups: 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Multimedia recording</b> &#8211; the group represents
permissions to any function that gives a MIDlet the ability to
capture still images, or to record video or audio clips.</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Read User Data Access</b> &#8211; the group represents
permissions to any function that gives a MIDlet the ability to read a
user's phone book, or any other data in a file or directory. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph"><b>Write User Data Access</b> &#8211; the group represents
permissions to any function that gives a MIDlet the ability to add or
modify a user's phone book, or any other data in a file or directory.
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Whenever new features are added to the MIDP they should be
assigned to the appropriate function group. In addition, APIs that
are specified elsewhere (that is, in other JSRs) but rely on the MIDP
security framework should also be assigned to an appropriate
function group. If none of the function groups defined in this
section is able to capture the new feature and reflect it to the user
adequately, however, then a new function group MUST be defined in
this document.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">If a new function group is to be added, the following should be
taken into consideration: the group to be added MUST not introduce
any redundancy to the existing groups, the new group MUST be capable
of protecting a wide range of similar features. The latter
requirement is to prevent introducing narrowly scoped groups. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">It is the function groups and not the individual permissions that
should be presented when the user is prompted.  Furthermore, it
is the function groups that should be presented to the user in the
settings of a given MIDlet suite. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Table 1 presents the policy that must be enforced using the
security framework as defined in MIDP 2.0. The table specifies the
available permission settings for each function group defined. 
Settings that are effective at the time the MIDlet is invoked for the
first time, and remain effective until the user changes them in the
MIDlet's configuration menu, are called "default settings."
  Settings available to the user in the configuration menu, to
which the user can change from a default setting, are called "other
settings." Together, default and other settings form a pool of
available configuration settings for the MIDlet. Default and other
settings are presented for each function group and each protection
domain. The naming of the function groups is implementation-specific
but MUST follow the guidelines of the function-group names defined in
this document as well as the definitions of these groups. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Tables 2 through 5 present individual permissions defined in the
MIDP 2.0 and other JSRs, and map to the function groups specified
in this section. An individual permission MUST occur in only one
function group. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">It is not mandatory for manufacturer and operator-trusted
applications to adhere to the settings defined in the following
tables, as the necessary user prompts should be given by the
application itself.  It is recommended that the manufacturer and
operator-trusted applications adhere to the permission guidelines
provided in the tables, and present appropriate prompts to the user
for the functions identified as security-protected.  <br>

<p class="Paragraph">The device MAY enhance and
simplify the user experience by applying a single set of
configuration settings (default or other), not just to a single
MIDlet, but to all MIDlets for a given signer. This option MUST
NOT compromise the function groups and available settings defined in
Table 1. If such an option exists, the user will be prompted to save
the settings and reuse them in future for applications from the same
source. Such a feature MAY also inform the user that a given source
has already been accepted and has an alias to the saved configuration
settings.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">For each trusted or untrusted application, the implementation MAY
read requested permissions from the MIDlet-Permissions and
MIDlet-PermissionsOpt attributes, notify the user which capability
the application requires, and prompt the user to accept or reject
installation of the application. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Note:  For applications in the Third-Party or the Untrusted domain, if any of the groups Net Access,
Messaging, and Local Connectivity has a Blanket permission, neither
Multimedia recording nor Read User Data Access can have a Blanket
permission, and vice versa.  This restriction is to ensure that
a MIDlet cannot activate both network connectivity and
user-privacy-related functions without user consent.<br><br>Similarly,
the Blanket setting for Application Auto Invocation and the Blanket
setting for Net Access are mutually exclusive. This constraint is to
prevent an application from auto-invoking itself, then accessing a
chargeable network without the user being aware.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">In the event that Net Access is
given Blanket permission in any of these combinations of
permissions, it MUST be downgraded to Session permission.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">For each Phone Call and Messaging
action, the implementation MUST present the user with the destination
phone number before the user approves the action. For the Messaging
group, if the implementation maps a single API call to more than one
message (that is, the implementation supports
disassembly/reassembly), the implementation MUST present the user
with the number of messages that will actually be sent out. This
requirement is to ensure that the user always understands the network
costs associated with running the program, whatever API calls are
involved.  </p>

<p class="Paragraph">
Note: The permissions for Mobile Media API are
yet to be defined in JSR135.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Implementations MUST ensure that I/O access from the Mobile Media
API follows the same security requirements as the Generic Connection
Framework, as specified in the package documentation for
javax.microedition.io.  Example methods include
javax.microedition.media.Player.start,
javax.microedition.media.Player.prefetch, etc.  When these
methods are used to fetch the content for the player via an HTTP
connection, the implementation MUST enforce the security requirements
specified for HTTP.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">When the user grants permission to a function group, this action
effectively grants access to all individual permissions under this
function group to which a MIDlet was authorized. This MUST not
include all the individual permissions from the group.  For
example, if a MIDlet was authorized to make an HTTP connection and
was not authorized to access any other protected functions from the
Net Access group, Blanket permission to a Net Access means permission
to make HTTP connections only. Individual permissions that were not
granted to the MIDlet by the MIDP authorization framework will not be
granted by a user allowing Net Access, as function groups are
served for the user representation only. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Implementation notes:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="Bullet1">
    <p class="Paragraph">An implementation MUST guarantee that a Security exception is
	thrown when the caller does not have the appropriate security
	permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="Bullet1">
    <p class="Paragraph">If a messaging group is granted a Oneshot
	permission, it translates into a Blanket permission for
	javax.microedition.io.Connector.sms and
	javax.microedition.io.Connector.cbs, as well as to permissions that
	enable receiving the messages.  Permission for sending the
	messages is still Oneshot, however; that is, the user grants
	permission to each message sent out by the MIDlet within an open
	connection. The
	same applies to the Session permission: functions related to sending
	the messages get Session permission, but other functions get Blanket
	permission."
	Blanket permission and No permission granted to the Messaging group
	apply to all individual permissions under this group.<br>
    </p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p class="Paragraph">If a MIDlet uses the capabilities defined in MIDP and other APIs,
the following rules MUST apply: 
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">All the external API functions
	  that need to be protected by MIDP 2.0 security framework MUST have
	  permissions defined in the subsequent JSRs, and follow the naming

	  titled "Security for MIDP Applications."
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">The functions that are not deemed

	  specification is released earlier than MIDP 2.0, any functions that

<h2 class="ChapterTitle">6  Permissions Granted to a
MIDlet Suite by the Authorization Mechanism</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">As defined in the "Security for MIDP Applications" section of the MIDP 2.0
specification, MIDlet suite permissions are effectively the
intersection of the domain permissions Midlet-Permission and
Midlet-Permission-Opt found in the JAR manifest. The way in which a
MIDlet's granted permissions are presented to the user is
implementation-specific, but the following rules must apply:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">The user must
	be able to change the default permission setting to any setting
	available for a given MIDlet permission, with default and available
	sets of user permission types provided as guides in the tables in
	Section 5. This latitude will allow the user to upgrade or downgrade
	the default permissions as required.
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">If MIDlet
	permissions are grouped according to capabilities they represent,
	permissions granted to a MIDlet suite will be rendered into the
	function groups to be presented to the user. If function grouping
	is used, default permission applies to the whole group of
	permissions under the group. So does the available set of types of
	user permissions. If the default permission is changed, the change
	is effective for the entire group at once rather than to the
	individual permissions under this group. 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A function group cannot be a union of
	permissions with different default settings and other settings. 
	Therefore the tables in Section 5 follow the convention of having
	the same default and available settings for all permissions in a
	single function group. This rule must be taken into account when
	designing new permissions and policies.
	
</li></ul>

<p class="Paragraph">A device MUST maintain security-related data for
each installed MIDlet, in addition to generic MIDlet information such
as MIDlet name and version number. The data MUST include at least the
following: 
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">The MIDlet's source, if the
	application was signed. At least MIDlet-Vendor MUST be stored along
	with the installed MIDlet. 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Data related to the root
	    certificate a signed MIDlet was authenticated to; at minimum the
	    Subject field of the root certificate. 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Data related to a signer
	    certificate that signed the MIDlet; at minimum the certificate's
	    Subject, Issuer, and Serial Number<i> </i>fields.  (As an
	    alternative, a device may store the entire certificate chain that
	    came with the MIDlet descriptor file.)
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A list of permissions granted to the MIDlet.

<h2 class="ChapterTitle">7  User Prompts and Notifications</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">The following rules MUST be followed in order to
ensure informed user consent to MIDlet actions: 
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">Any chargeable event generated by
	the MIDlet MUST be preceded by user notification, for example,
	showing the phone number the MIDlet is dialing, the URL being
	connected to, or the recipient of an SMS.
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Any chargeable event in progress
	(for example, peer-to-peer connection the user is charged for) MUST
	be indicated to the user. 

	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet MUST get user approval to

	of the policy. 
	
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Any MIDlet permissions must be
	presented to the user in an intuitive, user-friendly manner.

	the system or virtual machine. 
	
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet MUST not be able to
	simulate security warnings to mislead the user.

	<li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet MUST not be able to simulate key-press events to
	mislead the user. 
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ChapterTitle">8  MIDlet Download and Execution While Roaming
and After Changing the Smart Card</h2>
<p class="Paragraph">All previously authorized and installed MIDlets
MUST act in accordance with the device policy when the device is
roaming, or when the device smart card is changed. Newly downloaded
MIDlets are authenticated to the root certificates currently
available in the certificate store and are authorized in accordance
with the device policy. 
</p>
<p class="Paragraph">If device roaming or a smart-card change causes failure to access
network resources that the MIDlet was previously authorized to
access, then the implementation MUST NOT throw a SecurityException.
This failure is not related to MIDlet authorization, so the
implementation MUST throw an IOException instead.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">The permissions assigned to MIDlets installed in
the Manufacturer, Trusted Third-Party, and Untrusted domains are not
affected by changes of the (U)ICC [(U)ICC], but MIDlets
installed in the Operator domain MUST NOT execute if, after a
smart-card change, the SIM no longer holds the certificate containing
the operator root public key that was used to authenticate the MIDlet
to the Operator domain (the "authenticating root";
see Section 3.2, "Operator Domain").
</p>

<p Detection of whether a MIDlet in the Operator
domain can be executed  SHOULD follow the following mechanism:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet1">When a MIDlet is installed in the Operator domain,
it is 	signed by a certificate whose certification chain ends with the 	authenticating
root certificate, stored in the smart card with the Operator-domain key-usage
field.  The 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the 	value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey
(excluding the tag, length, 	and number of unused bits) from that root certificate,
termed  	the "authenticating root key hash" of the MIDlet, is 	stored
in the device along with the MIDlet (as specified in Section 	3.2).  	
	</li><li class="Bullet1">Whenever the smart card is changed, the 20-byte SHA-1
hash of 	the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, 
	length, and number of unused bits) of each certificate stored in the 	new
smart card with the Operator-domain key-usage field (Operator-domain root
key hashes) is computed and stored before any MIDlet in 	the Operator domain
is executed.  	
	</li><li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet in the Operator domain is disabled if
its 	authenticating root key hash does not correspond to one of the new Operator-domain
root key hashes generated after the smart card was 	changed.  	
</li></ul>


<p class="Paragraph">Whether a MIDlet in the Operator domain can
  be executed depends on a comparison of "root key hash"
  values, computed as the 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the value of the BIT
  STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of
  unused bits) of a root certificate.  The decision process SHOULD
  follow the following mechanism:</p>
      <ul type="disc">

	<li class="Bullet1">When a MIDlet is installed in the Operator domain, it
	      is signed by a certificate whose certification chain
	      ends with the authenticating root certificate, stored in

	      field.  The hash value of that certificate's
	      subjectPublicKey, termed the "authenticating root key
	      hash" of the MIDlet, is stored in the device along with
	      the MIDlet (as specified in Section 3.2).
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Whenever the smart card is changed, the "Operator-domain
	      root key hash" of each certificate stored in the new
	      smart card is computed and stored before any MIDlet in
	      the Operator domain is executed.
	
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet in the Operator domain is disabled if its
	      authenticating root key hash does not correspond to one
	      of the new Operator-domain root key hashes generated
	      after the smart card was changed 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">When a MIDlet is installed in the Operator domain, it is
	signed by a certificate whose certification chain ends with the
	authenticating root certificate. The hash value of that
	certificate's subjectPublicKey, termed the "authenticating root
	key hash" of the MIDlet, is stored in the device along with the
	MIDlet (as specified in Section 3.2).
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">Whenever the smart card is changed, the root key hash of each
	certificate stored in the new smart card is computed and stored
	before any MIDlet in the Operator domain is executed. 
	</li>
	<li class="Bullet1">A MIDlet in the Operator domain is disabled if its
	      authenticating root key hash does  
	      not correspond to one of the new Operator-domain root key
	      hashes generated after the smart card was changed 
	</li>
      </ul>
</p>



<p class="Paragraph">Note: In this mechanism, there are two steps the device
performs after the smart card has been changed: 1) computing the new Operator-domain
root key hashes; 2) for each MIDlet in the Operator domain, checking whether
its authenticating root key hash belongs to the set of new Operator-domain
root key hashes. An implementation MAY perform these two steps at any time,
provided NO Operator-domain MIDlet is executed after a smart card change
if its authenticating root key hash does NOT correspond to one of the new
Operator-domain root key hashes. Step 2 MAY be performed right after Step
1; alternatively, Steps 1 and 2 MAY be separated in time, in which case the
implementation SHOULD store the results of Step 1 securely so they will be
available in Step 2.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">If the Operator-domain root
certificate is not present at the specified location, the user MUST
be informed that the application cannot be executed without the
authorizing root certificate. The device
SHOULD also give the user the option to get information on the root
certificate that was used to authenticate the application to the Operator domain. This information SHOULD include the <i>Subject</i>
field of the root certificate.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">Although it is mandatory only
to check whether authenticating roots are still present in the smart
card when the smart card is changed, an implementation MAY choose to
check on more occasions and, accordingly, to disable applications in
the Operator domain as specified.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">If a MIDlet cannot be executed because the
authenticating Operator root public key is absent, the device MUST
NOT delete the application. The device MAY inform the user in advance
via an appropriate mechanism whether an application could execute or
not, for example using a "disabled" look-and-feel in the
display. However, the user MUST be able to delete these
disabled applications.</p>
